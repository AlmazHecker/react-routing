# React Routing

React Routing is a library for [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) that helps with routing and navigation.

## Installation

To install React Routing, use npm:

```bash
npm install @almazhecker/react-routing@0.0.1
```

## Usage

To use React Routing in your React application, import the BrowserRouter component and wrap your app with it.

Then, define your routes using the Routes component and specify the path and component for each route.

```javascript
import { RouterProvider, Routes } from '@almazhecker/react-routing';

const routes = [
  { path: '/', component: <Home /> },
  { path: '/about', component: <About /> },
  { path: '/contact', component: <Contact /> },
];

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes />
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}
```
